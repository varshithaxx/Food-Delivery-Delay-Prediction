# Food-Delivery-Delay-Prediction
# Project Overview

This project uses a dataset of food deliveries to predict delivery delays.
# Tech Stack
* Python

* Pandas, NumPy for data processing

* Scikit-learn for machine learning

* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
# Dataset
The dataset contains features like
order time, restaurant location, delivery distance, traffic conditions, etc.
Used for training the model to predict delay time and delivery status.
# Results
* Predicts whether a delivery will be on time, delayed, or late.

* Provides predicted delay time in minutes.

* Includes visualizations and model performance metrics.
